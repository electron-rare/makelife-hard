# makelife-hard

Hardware design files, PCB exports, and MCP automation servers for electronic manufacturing.

Part of the [FineFab](https://github.com/L-electron-Rare) platform (Factory 4 Life).

## What it does

- Hosts KiCad schematics, PCB layouts, and reusable design blocks
- Runs automated DRC/ERC validation and KiBot export pipelines
- Exposes MCP servers for AI-assisted hardware design workflows
- Generates manufacturing evidence packs (Gerber, BOM, pick-and-place)

## Tech stack

KiCad | Python | KiBot | MCP Protocol

## Quick start

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m tools.export --project hardware/my_board
```

## Project structure

```
